          <h2 class="blog-post-title" id="DAN">Those Damned Danger!s</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">April 3, 2019 by Timothy</p>

          <p><em>"Draw discard summon draw discard summon draw discard, hey is your turn over yet? It's been 10
              minutes."</em></p>
          <br>
          <p> It was your average winter day, was attending a local having just gotten back into Yu-Gi-Oh. Round 2 of
            the tournament was approaching, and
            little did I know, I was about to be in for 40 mintues of pure pain. I had no way to prepare for this
            archetype of monsters I had hardly seen
            until that very moment, when I learned about one of the most splashable engines I'd ever seen. The full
            cancer of special summon Upstart Goblins appeared:
            <strong>Danger!s</strong>.
          </p>

          <img src="images/snek.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 20px" />
          <img src="images/nessie.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px" />


          <h2>Free Bodies of Pain</h2>
          <p>There are a myriad of reasons I can complain about Danger!s. So let me first say that at least the
            archetype has some cool art. Cryptids
            are a pretty good idea for an archetype. The problem comes, however, when we hit the actual effects of that
            archetype. Danger!s are entirely
            dependent upon random chance to make plays. Each Danger! has the effect to reveal itself, and summon itself
            if it doesn't get randomly discarded
            by a die roll. Since Danger!s are so generic, and since discarding can sometimes be a huge benefit in the
            modern meta (Zombies even benefit from it)
            Danger!s are powerful and really easy to splash into other decks for a huge power boost. The power to keep
            drawing while making link monsters like <a
              href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Curious,_the_Lightsworn_Dominion">Curious</a>
            and make stupid boards that rip cards from the opponents hand or like what happened to me, where my entire
            turn was literally skipped.
          </p>

          <img src="images/bunny.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px;" />
          <img src="images/bigfoot.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 20px;" />

          <p> Personally, I think the entire archetype just needs to go. As long as they exist, they'll be abused one way or 
            another to do some degenerate strategy. They discourage creative deckbuilding by being so generically splashable, 
            and discourage strategic play by being completely RNG based. Not to mention that the cost to build the engine is actually 
            insane, leaving them out of reach for many a budget player. For a much healthier Yu-Gi-Oh!, the Danger!s must become as actual 
            cryptids: Non-existent.

          <h2 class="blog-post-title" id="SKY">One Anime Girl, Lots of Rage</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">April 2, 2019 by Timothy</p>

          <p><em>"Alright, Engage. Draw. Engage. Draw. Summon Kagari. Get Engage-"</em></p>
          <br>
          <p>Compared to last post where I happily talked about one of my favorite long time decks, now I'm gonna talk
            about a deck that I have a
            personal vendetta against. Introducing the one, the only: <strong>Sky Strikers</strong>.
          </p>

          <img src="images/raye.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px" />
          <img src="images/kagari.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 20px" />

          <h2>One Protagonist</h2>
          <p>So if you're unaware, Sky Strikers is an archetype that released May last year, and immediately become a
            top
            tier deck. The deck has shown
            incredible consistency in it's ability to steadily grind the enemy out of resources while continuing to add
            cards to hand. The deck consists mostly
            of spell cards which are themed as mecha upgrades to the anime girl above: the Sky Striker Raye. She's the
            only main deck monster of the archetype.
            All the other monsters of the archetype are in the Extra deck, which are her in various different mech
            outfits. Theming wise, it's pretty cool. It's like
            a classic mecha anime show. The way the deck plays, however, doesn't really do it for me.
          </p>

          <img src="images/multirole.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px" />
          <img src="images/engage.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 20px" />

          <h2>Massive Card Advantage</h2>
          <p> Engage and Multirole are cards that cause me much physical pain. Engage searching any card in the
            archetype combined with a free draw just generates consistently
            massive advantage, whilst multirole ensures that the cards in the graveyard come back to haunt the opponent
            for another round. Getting hit by multiple <a
              href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Sky_Striker_Mecha_-_Widow_Anchor">Widow Anchors</a>, and having
            either your effects negated
            or your monsters just straight up taken is very painful, especially when it goes on turn after turn. The
            deck even has the potential to
            win in one turn by stealing enough monsters to make <a
              href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Borrelsword_Dragon">Borrelsword</a>, which adds insult to injury.
          </p>
          <p> The deck has consistently won event after event, to the point that many players are starting to get sick
            of it. After almost a full year of never having been targeted
            by the banlist, I think the time has come for the deck to receive some hits. Personally, I'm a fan of
            hitting Engage to only 2 copies allowed, and limiting Kagari to 1.
            This lowers the consistency of strikers, but doesn't completely disable them. Honestly, I wouldn't mind
            never seeing the deck again, but as long as it gets hit just a bit,
            I'll be happy. I don't think decks should be allowed to be this consistent while generating such insane
            advantage. With a hit to Strikers, I think the metagame will get a bit
            healthier, and a little less weeby.

          <h2 class="blog-post-title" id="ZOM">A Love for the Undead</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">April 2, 2019 by Timothy</p>

          <p><em>"You can't summon that. All your monsters are zombies."</em></p>
          <br>
          <p>Hey everyone. First post of my blog here, and I thought I'd start it all off by talking about one of my all
            time favorite deck types: <strong>Zombies.</strong></p>

          <h2>The Undead Rise Up</h2>
          <p>Ever since I was a wee lad and first received a Zombie structure deck, the play style always seemed so cool
            to me. In line with how zombies are, it focuses on turning
            your opponents monsters into Zombie types to disrupt them and make your own zombies stronger. It also
            involves a lot of graveyard revival shenanigans, much in the way zombies
            come back from the dead. It's a fun control idea that still lives to this day despite Zombie World being
            older than dirt.
          </p>

          <img src="images/zombieworld.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 20px" />
          <img src="images/redeyes.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px" />

          <h2>The Modern Variant</h2>
          <p>Relatively recently, Zombies received new support in the form of the <a
              href="https://www.amazon.com/Yu-Gi-Oh-83717840510-YUGIOH-Zombie-Structure/dp/B07G8Q41PW">Zombie Horde
              structure deck.</a>
            It features many of the support cards zombies have received over the years, such as <a
              href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Uni-Zombie">Uni-Zombie</a> and <a
              href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Shiranui_Solitaire">Shiranui Solitaire</a>, as well as completely new
            cards
            that focus on supporting Zombie World, like <a
              href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Necroworld_Banshee">Necroworld Banshee</a> who can activate it using
            her effect, and <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Glow-Up_Bloom">Glow-Up Bloom</a>,
            who can summon out zombies while Zombie World is out on the field. All of these cards exist to support two
            purposes: Synchro
            summoning powerful monsters, and to bring out the newly introduced Zombie boss monster: Doomking Balerdroch.
          </p>

          <img src="images/doomking.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px" />

          <p> He makes for an absolute beast of a boss monster, with the ability to recur himself from the grave every
            standby phase, as well as one monster negate and one monster
            banish each turn. Going up against this monster can be a big deal for many decks focused on monster effects.
            On top of all that, he's got some sick ass artwork, which
            all culminates to make him one of my favorite monsters ever created in this game.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>The Downside of the Dead</h2>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, this deck isn't all brains and gains. When this deck bricks, it bricks HARD. Despite having
            strong plays,
            the deck has many consistency issues. The best zombie search cards we have are <a
              href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Pyramid_Turtle">Pyramid Turtle</a>, who needs to be destroyed by
            battle,
            and <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Goblin_Zombie">Goblin Zombie</a>, who is a big brick in hand.
            The deck also loses heavily to Handtraps like Ash and Effect Veiler, as well as
            the ever so common Called By The Grave, which one will often lose Doomking to.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Nevertheless, in spite of all that, I love this deck as if it were my son, and I'll continue to represent
            it at my local scene whenever I can. And maybe one day, Konami will answer my
            prayers and zombies will rise to take the meta.
          </p>
